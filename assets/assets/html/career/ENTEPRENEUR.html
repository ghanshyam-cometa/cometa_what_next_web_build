Building your own dreams or getting hired by someone to help them
build theirs? Whether you're a fresher or a professional who has
worked for different companies over the years, the thought of
starting a business of your own and becoming an entrepreneur must
have monopolised your mind at some point in your life. The best thing
about becoming an entrepreneur is that you can start whenever you
want, generate employment opportunities for others, and be your own
boss, forever.</font></font></p>

is no guaranteed success, there is a great deal of learning as you

business idea is generated, an entrepreneur has to undertake many
activities to transform it into reality. Starting from market
research to study competitors (if any) and identify the target
audience, to the recruitment of professionals, taking care of the
financial aspects and administering the entire work – there are
multiple stages involved in setting up a new venture.</font></font></p>

there has been a surge in the number of people turning to
entrepreneurship to bring their ideas to life. Many colleges and
universities are also encouraging such people by launching Courses in
Entrepreneurship and Family Business, apart from offering the
traditional business management degrees.</font></font></p>

entrepreneur can be found in any field, industry or organisation.
He/she could be an inventor, artist, educator, professional, or a
businessman. While entrepreneurship means starting a new venture,
there are various career paths that lead up to it. Moreover, having
some industry experience in hand prior to becoming an entrepreneur
equips you with the right skill set, some new contacts and puts some
savings in your bank account to give you a head start so that you're
able to run your business effectively. Here's a list of fields that
you may consider before you head out to start something of your own!</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><font color="#333333"><font face="Arial, serif"><b>Management
–&nbsp;</b></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Arial, serif">Try
and get into a management role before starting your own venture. When
you're at a managerial position, you learn to delegate tasks,
you&nbsp;learn the importance of teamwork, your time-management
skills improve and you also learn resource-optimisation. Having all
these skills becomes extremely important when you're running a
business.</font></font></p>

you're an aspiring entrepreneur, working in sales can prove to be
extremely beneficial as you gain strong communication skills because
of your day-to-day dealing with people. As you get better at talking
to people, your persuasion skills also improve. Your ability to
convince customers, and meet their demands determines your survival
in the business, and that's exactly how it works when you're an
entrepreneur.</font></font></p>

Relations–</b></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Arial, serif">&nbsp;Public
relations specialists work to create a good public image of a
business or company through press releases, writing speeches, and
ensure advertising programs are helping. Entrepreneurs would benefit
from working in this profession, as they would learn how to make
their company appeal to the public. Public relations specialists need
a bachelor's degree to work in the field.</font></font></p>

keeping financial aspects in mind such as investments, taxes,
allocation of budgets for marketing, recruitment, etc. is extremely
important.</font></font></p>

Service –</b></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Arial, serif">&nbsp;Working
